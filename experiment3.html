                    TOM</a></h3>
            <p>Thomas Jasper "Tom" Cat is a fictional character and one of the two titular main protagonists (the other
                being
                Jerry Mouse) in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's series of Tom and Jerry theatrical animated short films. Created
                by
                William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, he is a grey and white anthropomorphic domestic short haired mute
                Tuxedo
                cat
                who first appeared in the 1940 MGM animated short Puss Gets the Boot. The cat was known as "Jasper"
                during
                his debut in the short; however, beginning with his next appearance in The Midnight Snack he was known
                as
                "Tom" or "Thomas".</p>

        <p>His name, "Tom Cat", is based on "tomcat", a word which refers to male cats. He is usually mute and rarely
            heard speaking with the exception of a few cartoons (such as 1943's The Lonesome Mouse, 1944's The Zoot Cat,
            1947's Part Time Pal and 1992's Tom and Jerry: The Movie). His only notable vocal sounds outside of this are
            his various screams whenever he is subjected to panic or, more frequently, pain. He is continuously after
            Jerry Mouse, for whom he sets traps, many of which backfire and cause damage to him rather than Jerry. His
            trademark scream was provided by creator William Hanna.

            Tom has changed over the years upon his evolution, especially after the first episodes. For example, in his
            debut, he was quadrupedal. However, over the years (since the episode Dog Trouble), he has become almost
            completely bipedal and has human intelligence and he is similar to his previous appearance, in 1945 shorts
            he had twisted whiskers and his appearance kept changing. In the 1940s and early 1950s, he had white fur
            between his eyes. In newer cartoons, the white fur is gone. As a slapstick cartoon character, Tom has a
            superhuman level of elasticity. Tom is usually defeated (or very rarely, killed, like in Mouse Trouble,
            where he explodes) in the end, although there are some stories where he outwits and defeats Jerry. Though
            besides Jerry he also has trouble with many other mouse characters or cat characters. One of them that
            appears frequently is Spike Bulldog. Spike regularly appears and usually assists Jerry and beats up Tom.
            Though in some occasions Tom beats him or he turns on Jerry (like his debut appearance in Dog Trouble) .
            Usually when Tom is chasing Jerry after a bit Jerry turns the tables on Tom and beats him or uses an outside
            character such as Spike to beat Tom.

            Tom has variously been portrayed as a house cat doing his job, and a victim of Jerry's blackmail attempts,
            sometimes within the same short. He is almost always called by his full name "Thomas" by Mammy Two Shoes.
